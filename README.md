# PythonTwitchBot
A Chat Bot for Twitch written in Python

This project was created because there are few, if any, functional Twitch chat bots available in an easy language like Python.

To run the bot, you need to download the files, edit cfg.py, and run bot.py.
This bot is completely barebones - there are virtually NO commands included, so you'll have to add custom commands yourself. Instructions for edits are documented in bot.py
