# PythonTwitchBot
A Chat Bot for Twitch written in Python

This project was created because there are few, if any, functional Twitch chat bots available in an easy language like Python.
I made this for DebugThis' stream (I'm a moderator of his), and I decided that I may as well share my work with the world.

To run the bot, you need to download the files, edit cfg.py, and run bot.py.
This bot is completely barebones - there are virtually NO commands included, so you'll have to add custom commands yourself. Instructions for edits are documented in bot.py

If people want them, I'll add some premade commands.

If you want to contribute, feel free to add some features yourself, or just come to DebugThis' stream (twitch.tv/DebugThis) and take a look at my bot in action.
